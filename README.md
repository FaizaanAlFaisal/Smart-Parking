# Smart-Parking

This project is designed to be an all-encompassing solution for a smart parking. 

The first component is a script that allows easy (manual) labelling of parking spots with a selection-tool.

The second component automatically picks up those labelled parking spots from a stored location, and detects whether a vehicle is parked in those spaces or not.

This allows a simple and interactive way of determining free spots in a parking area.
